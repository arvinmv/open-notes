#### Good reads

#### Textbooks
-Think Python, How to think like a computer scientist (A good first read)

-The Coderâ€™s Apprentice, Learning Programming with Python 3 (Another good read)

-How to think like a computer scientist, Learning with Python 3 documentation (A good follow-on for writing Pythonic code)

-Many, many others...The most important thing is to stay away from bad resources, to pick any of the ones that are reasonably good and to start coding as you move through the text.
